<h2>Epoxy resin in a simple way</h2>

<p>
Epoxy resin belongs to the family of two-component resins, which include "resin" and "hardener".
<br>
These two components must be mixed in a certain proportion, according to its formulation and application, and 
<br>
then applied to the desired surface or mold.
</p>

<h3>What is Resin Epoxy?</h3>

<p>
The resin base or part A is the basis of our work, which requires the hardening of part B (epoxy hardener). There
<br>
 are different types of resin bases, most of which are available in the market and are suitable for our work, such as

<h3>A variety of commonly used epoxy hardeners</h3>

<p>
The most widely used epoxy hardeners are divided into two main groups:


<br>Polyamine hardeners
<br>Polyamid hardeners


</p>

<hr>

<h3>What is the use of polyamine hardener and epoxy resin?</h3>
<p>
In decorative works, a special type of hardener is usually used, which is called "polyamine". Polyamine hardeners
<br> are usually colorless and can be used in bulk. Polyamine hardener is dilute and cannot be added to the solvent
<br> (not soluble).
</p>

<p>
As I said, these two components must be mixed in a certain proportion, according to the manufacturer's instructions,
<br> and poured into the desired container or mold, so that after a certain period of time, it becomes extremely 
<br>difficult to take the shape of the mold.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>What is the use of polyamide hardener and epoxy resin?</h3>
<p>
Another type of hardener called "polyamide" is produced, which has the ability to combine epoxy resin. The polyamide
<br> hardener is reddish-orange in color and has a high error. Polyamide is also soluble, meaning you can add certain
<br> solvents to the polyamide hardener to dilute it. Of course, keep in mind that this type of hardener will not be 
<br>suitable for making resin tables, resin jewelry and resin decorative parts, and they are mainly used for epoxy flooring.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Why isn't polyamide suitable for making jewelry and resin tables?</h3>
<p>
As mentioned, polyamide, according to its formulation, has a much higher concentration than polyamine and must be added to 
<br>the solvent to be applicable. This solvent added will remain in the system and can make the resin brittle and brittle in 
<br>large volumes. On the other hand, the dark color of polyamide does not make it usable in decorative works and is only used
<br> in epoxy flooring as well as a thin layer for primer.

<h3>What is a two-component epoxy resin?</h3>
<p>
Most of the epoxy resins in the world are in two parts, the resin base and the hardener, which must be combined in a certain 
<br>proportion. Of course, single-part and three-part epoxy resins are also produced, which have special uses.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Where to buy epoxy resin?</h3>
<p>
When you go to the market to buy epoxy resin (sellers of chemicals andonline stores), the so-called component A and component
<br> B are called epoxy resins. Although the name only refers to component A, most sellers do not separate the epoxy resin and 
<br>the hardener, and simply use the word epoxy or epoxy resin alone, all of which are the same concept. In this article, 
<br>wherever you see the word epoxy resin, it means mixing both components A and B, and if there is a need for separation, 
<br>I will specify by naming the components.
</p>
<h3>How does epoxy resin dry?</h3>
<p>
According to its formulation, epoxy resin dries superficially after a few hours to a day, and it also takes seven days for the
<br> epoxy resin to reach its maximum hardness and for chemical bonds to form between the resin and the hardener. Drying time 
<br>and Epoxy cooking time varies depending on the type of resin and hardener.

<h3>What is epoxy resin flooring?</h3>
<p>
One of the most widely used fields for using epoxy resin is epoxy flooring, of which I will mention a few examples:
<ul class = "horiz-ss" style = "text-align = center">
<li style = "text-align = center">Industrial epoxy flooring, for factories with very strong mechanical and chemical resistance</li>
<li style = "text-align = center">Conductive anti-static epoxy flooring to conduct static electricity</li>
<li style = "text-align = center">Antibacterial epoxy flooring for hospitals and pollution-sensitive centers</li>
<li style = "text-align = center">Three-dimensional epoxy flooring, which is one of the new ideas used in the flooring of houses and decorative 
<br>works, and has a very good income</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>What is wood epoxy resin?</h3>
<p>
The new field of work with epoxy resin is the construction of tables and decorative objects by combining epoxy resin and wood, which has the
<br> following applications:
<br>
